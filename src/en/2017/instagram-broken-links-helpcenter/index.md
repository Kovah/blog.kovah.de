Instagram has fixed the link and now provides a new contact form on the following page: <a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/504521742987441">https://help.instagram.com/contact/504521742987441</a>

A couple of weeks ago I first visited [Instagram’s Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/) on the search for a form to report an image that violates the “Persönlichkeitsrecht”, a German law that protects a persons rights on pictures that show the person itself. This law is helpful if you want to remove an image of yourself, posted by another user.

After clicking trought a large bunch of help pages, following one link after another, I finally found the [correct page](https://help.instagram.com/122717417885747) that informs about the possibility to report an Image posted on Instagram, that violates your rights. Unfortunately [the linked form](https://help.instagram.com/help/instagram/contact/504521742987441) was not avalailable.

Today, the form is still not avilable. But it seems it’s harder to find a way to inform any of the Instagram staff than being killed in a shark attack. However, this topic is extremely important so I tried to find a way to contact Instagram. The following table will show you all tried options from Instagram accounts to Twitter.
