It's just hiliarous to read about foreigners complaining or making jokes about the German language. If German is your mother tounge you may not notice how convenient your language could be. While most other languages would need several words to discribe a certain thing, action or also emotion, in German you just simply make one long word that is a description on its own.

And a notable read-on: Mark Twains [The awful German language](http://www.kombu.de/twain-2.htm) which points our more funny things about the wonderful language of the country of pretzels and beer.
