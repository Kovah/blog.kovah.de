Just noticed this small grey button with that small red pidgeon on it in the reddit sidebar. Clicked on it and now I'm in a chat room that grows snowball-like every few minutes if all user voted to grow. Very weird. It's called [Robin](https://www.reddit.com/robin/).

**Update one hour later:**
Interesting concept with this Robin chat. We are now about 20 users in the merged group and talk about food and where we come from. One guy talks about pizza and pepperoni the whole time. I'm curious where this will lead to.

**Update three hours later:**
I just quit reading the chat. It became a multi-thread, quiz and text RPG chat with its own John Madden bot with about 200 new messages every minute.
