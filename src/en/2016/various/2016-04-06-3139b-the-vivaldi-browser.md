Just found a blog post about that the [Vivaldi browser](https://vivaldi.com/) is finally out of beta. Downloaded the browser and tested it. Runs pretty smooth and is entirely customizable. You can select where the tabs are located and how they look. And the best: Vivaldi runs with Chromium.

Tested the browser speed: 3262 Points on [Peacekeeper](http://peacekeeper.futuremark.com/results?key=CvFz&resultId=8865811) and 5157 on [Basemark](http://web.basemark.com/results)
