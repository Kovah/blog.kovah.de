As reported by SimilarWeb, the number of daily active users of the Pokémon Go app is about to surpass Twitter's native app. Currently residing at about 3% it will soon reach the 3.5% of the Twitter app.  

Pokémon Go was released just five days ago, at July 6th. Since the release the news reported a lot about the app and it is currently the most downloaded app in the US iOS App Store with the highest revenue at this time. Niantic, the developer of the app, stopped other worldwide releases because of server capacity problems.
