Inline SVG animations are a new trend for 2017 and allow you to animate the strokes of your SVGs. The first library for these animations was written in Javascript. However, you don't need Javascript for that. Try [Vivus Instant](https://maxwellito.github.io/vivus-instant/): CSS only inline SVG animations.
