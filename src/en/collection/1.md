This is the first Collection: a random list of interesting articles, neat websites and cool tools around web development, programming, technology in the broad term, and the internet.

I decided to introduce this content format because I find so mush helpful stuff on the internet which I like to share with others. Instead of having dozens of unrelated Tweets, the Collections will contain the most exciting links I found in the past days or weeks. Collections will not be published on a regular base. This is not a weekly newsletter thingy, but I will share all collections via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kovah_kvh) and other networks, so make sure to follow me.
