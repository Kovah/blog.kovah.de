Kinguin.net (G2A competitor) [announces "Indie Valley"](http://www.kinguin.net/blog/indie-valley): a new service for indie developers to sell keys with 24/7 support in multiple languages and help with fraud chargebacks. It will fill the gap between normal key selling sites like G2A and Steam, which is indeed a powerful game publishing platform.
