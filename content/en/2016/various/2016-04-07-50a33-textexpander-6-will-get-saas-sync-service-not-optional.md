Another the-ceo-decided-to-use-saas-no-matter-what thing: Textexpander 6 will get a SaaS sync service that is **not optional**, for $5/month. A power-user [says he has no clue](http://rhymeswithdiploma.com/post/142315992434/textexpander-6-or-how-not-to-launch-your-saas) why he has to pay $5/month for not a single benefit.

Sad story. But if they want to ruin their business let them take the stairs to heaven. Or hell. Whatever.
