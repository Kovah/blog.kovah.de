You're able to program little games with CSS **only**. Yes, CSS **only**! That's really crazy.
Una Kravets explains how to use `counter-increment`, `counter-reset` and checkboxes to make little games in [her blog post](http://una.im/css-games/). I mean this is also pretty useful for any other types of user interaction where you would have to use JavaScript.

### Example Game

See the Pen [Pure CSS (Sass) Carnival Game](http://codepen.io/una/pen/NxZaNr/) by Una Kravets ([@una](http://codepen.io/una)) on [CodePen](http://codepen.io).
